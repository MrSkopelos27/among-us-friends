                <br />
                Players have a hidden crew Elo and a hidden impostor Elo.
                Players are measured against the average of the other team. For
                the first 30 games, players lose and gain more Elo (Ã  la{" "}

                ). After missing 40 games in a row, Elo will slowly decay.
